                        <p>There are many ways, we will show the most important of them:
                            <ul>
                                <li>1. Start with warm-up exercises</li>
                                <li>2. Exercise gradually according to its difficulty</li>
                                <li>3. Practice difficult exercises with caution</li>
                                <li>4. Scientific recognition of muscles</li>
                                <li>5. Transition from devices to free weights</li>
                                <li>6. Follow a specific diet</li>
                                <li>7. Do muscle-building exercises at least twice a week</li>
                                <li>8. Comfort</li>  
                            </ul>
                        </p>    
                        <h2>Can I follow the keto diet?</h2>
                        <p>We don't recommend a keto diet for people with type 1 diabetes.
                             For people with type 2 diabetes,
                              we recommend consulting a specialist or dietitian to see if the keto diet is appropriate.

                        <h2>Is eating high amounts of protein a day harmful?</h2>
                        <p>Yes, it is definitely harmful,
                             because protein supplements when taking large amounts of them above the normal range increase the risk of kidney stress and increase the risk of kidney failure in severe cases,
                              in addition to other harms, including the following:
                            <ul>
                                <li>1. Increased uric acid in the blood, higher risk of arthritis.</li>
                                <li>2. Digestive disorders, such as colic, indigestion, and diarrhea.</li>
                                <li>3. Exposure to contamination if proteins are not preserved in the correct storage method.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>    
                        <h2>What is the push pull leg system?</h2>
                        <p>It is a training program that divides the body into 3 groups: the muscles of the upper body that can push, the muscles of the upper body that can pull, and the muscles of the lower part i.e. the legs.
                            <br>This program is perhaps the most effective program because there are related muscle groups that are trained together in the same exercise.
                             <br>This means that you get maximum overlap of movements in the same exercise, and the muscle groups that are trained get the overall benefit of this overlap.

                        <p>Fruit is a source of carbohydrates,
                             meaning that it will be digested for blood glucose.
                              Regardless of the increase in blood sugar with eating fruit,
                               fruit is very beneficial for our health,
                               and it is recommended to eat at least two servings of fruit per day.
                                People with type 2 diabetes may be advised to limit fruit intake to just two servings a day to maintain regular blood sugar.

                           <br><br>Therefore, it is recommended to introduce healthy fats to the diet, and replace foods rich in saturated fats with foods containing monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats, such as: omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids.

                        <p>The importance of sport lies in the ability to integrate pleasure and benefit together. That's why we always recommend a regular exercise regimen based on your type of sports, along with a weight loss diet with complete meals.
                             Here's a list of suggestions for fun, powerful and effective exercises:
                            <ul>
                                <li>1. Pilates</li>
                                <li>2. High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT): Jumping exercises such as scissors - Jumping and squatting - Rope exercises - Barbiz
                                </li>
                                <li>3. Strength exercises: 
                                        Weightlifting
                                       - Plank exercises
                                       - Squats (Squats)
                                </li>
                                <li>4. Cardiovascular exercises</li>
                                <li>5. Walk</li>
                                <li>6. Swimming</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>    
                        <h2>Do I train in many groups and less weight or less groups and a big weight?</h2>
                        <p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>1. Many people (especially women) wrongly believe that lifting heavy weights automatically leads to huge muscles,
                                     so they prefer lighter weights or no weights at all.</li>
                                <li>2. The key factor is training to muscle fatigue, not the actual weight size — muscle growth depends on how you exercise,
                                     not just how heavy the weight is.</li>
                                <li>3. Choosing the right weight isn’t about guessing or extremes;
                                     it should follow specific rules to avoid using too little (wasting effort) or too much (causing bad form).</li>

                        <h2>What is the most appropriate method to strengthen muscles?</h2>
                        <p>It is preferable to focus on certain types of exercises to strengthen muscles quickly, especially strength training, which can be practiced based on body weight,
                             or based on external pressure forces. Examples include:
                            <ul>
                                <li>1. Body weight exercises, such as push-ups and squats.</li>

                                <li>3. Exercise using: weight machines and weights available in the gym,

                        <p>Drinking too much water can dangerously dilute your blood’s sodium levels (causing hyponatremia),
                             leading to symptoms like confusion, seizures,
                             and in severe cases, coma or death.
